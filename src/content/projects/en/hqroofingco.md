This project consists of a website originally developed in WordPress, designed to promote roofing services and act as a strategic tool for lead generation through contact forms.

### Initial State and Problematic Issues

The platform was delivered by the clients with severe technical deficiencies that hindered its correct operation and compromised the company's image:

- **Security Compromise**: The WordPress installation had been hacked, resulting in the injection of malware, malicious files, and inappropriate explicit content within the site.
- **Access Management**: Administrative access credentials were non-existent or could not be located by the owners.
- **Visual Issues**: The style system (CSS) presented critical failures that affected navigation and the professional design of the page.

### Actions Performed

To rescue the project, a comprehensive intervention plan was executed, which included:

1. **Sanitization**: Mitigation and total removal of malware and injected files.
2. **Style Restoration**: Correction of CSS errors to restore the site's visual integrity.
3. **Optimization**: Improvements in general site performance to ensure efficient loading.
4. **Data Cleanup**: Removal of files and residual data generated by both the cyberattack and previous administrations.

### Backend and Lead Generation

A custom solution for storing quotes was developed using **Google Apps Script**. The main objective is to process and save the information sent by users through the site's forms in an external and secure manner.

### Technical Challenge: WordPress - Apps Script Integration

During implementation, it was detected that the **WordPress and Elementor** ecosystem could not correctly interpret the responses sent by Google Apps Script. This caused data communication failures.

#### Implemented Solution: Custom Mini-Plugin

To resolve this incompatibility, a custom PHP plugin was developed to act as a communication bridge:

- **Internal Webhook**: The plugin generates an endpoint within WordPress.
- **Data Redirection**: It receives form information and redirects it via a webhook to Google Apps Script.
- **Intermediate Architecture**: This layer resolved the response interpretation problem, ensuring that the data flow was successful and transparent for the user.

### SEO and Monitoring

A robust infrastructure for site tracking and positioning was implemented:

- **Google Analytics**: Full configuration for monitoring traffic and user behavior.
- **Google Search Console**: Connection and validation for indexing control.
- **File Debugging**: Multiple unnecessary and junk files were removed to optimize the site's health for search engines, ensuring that the malware's trail was completely erased.
