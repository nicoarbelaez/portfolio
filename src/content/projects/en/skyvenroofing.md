## Technology Used for the Build

### Main Frameworks and Tools

- [Astro](https://astro.build/): Modern framework for creating fast, optimized websites  
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): Utility-first styling system for responsive design  
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/): High-performance component library for interactive elements  
- [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/): Centralized management of form contacts  
- [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/turnstile/): Security system for forms that prevents spam  

Astro was chosen as the primary solution for its ability to build optimized sites using components from different frameworks. This allowed us to develop efficient interfaces by combining Preact for interactivity and Tailwind CSS for responsive styling.

### Deployment Technologies

- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/): Advanced DNS service with caching capabilities  
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/): Deployment platform optimized for static sites  

The configuration uses Cloudflare for DNS and security services, leveraging its free tier to meet project requirements. Vercel was implemented for automated deployments thanks to its native integration with Astro and efficient static site handling.
