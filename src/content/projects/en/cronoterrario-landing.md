The **CronoTerrario Landing Page** project is a landing page developed during a SENA course, with the primary goal of driving sales for an innovative, fictional product: a static micro-ecosystem created from an obsolete clock. This concept turns an otherwise discarded object into a one-of-a-kind decorative piece, capturing the user’s attention at first glance.

## Context and Objective

During a hands-on module at SENA, the challenge was to quickly and effectively build a landing page capable of selling a reinvented product made from an obsolete item. The key objectives were:

- **Creative Upcycling**: Transform a broken clock into an aesthetically pleasing and conceptually functional element.
- **User Engagement**: Spark interest and curiosity through animations and clear calls to action.
- **Concept Validation**: Demonstrate technical and design skills in a learning environment.
